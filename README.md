After completing my Ph.D. defense, I began to reflect on a fundamental question:

What is the true meaning of dedicating years to time-series forecasting and modeling research?

How can what we study in academia be translated vertically into real industrial impact?

In recent years, the field of time-series forecasting seems to have entered a peculiar loop. Many researchers are overwhelmingly focused on reducing loss values. If a model achieves slightly lower error than previous methods, it is declared state-of-the-art. To achieve this, increasingly complex attention mechanisms are designed, computational costs are escalated, and sometimes questionable model architectures or experimental settings are justified solely because they reduce loss.

But does this truly matter?
